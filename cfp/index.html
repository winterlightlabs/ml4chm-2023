    <p>This workshop has three primary goals: (1) bring together experts from multiple disciplines working on
        ML and CMH to learn from each other, (2) encourage the development of shared goals and approaches across these
        communities, and (3) stimulate creation of better MM technologies for real-world CMH impact. To achieve these
        goals, our workshop will include a diverse lineup of invited speakers across fields associated with ML and CMH,
        hosting experts from computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), MM learning, signal processing,
        human-computer interaction, neuroscience, psychiatry, and psychology. To encourage discussion and
        further collaboration toward the advancement of ML for CMH, our workshop will combine invited talks,
        contributed papers and posters, panel discussion, and bird-of-feather (BoF) discussion session on four different
        topics. In addition, we will host a mentorship program, in order to increase reach and to help researchers from
        across the world who are new to this field to improve the quality of their papers before the submission time.

        Multimodal research focuses on collecting resources, developing models,
        and evaluating systems that need to jointly reason over multiple sources of data. Recently, a few works have
        started to exploit the synchronization of multimodal streams to improve prediction of patient status or response
        to treatment in cognitive and mental health applications. This workshop encourages and promotes research efforts
        towards more inclusive multimodal technologies for cognitive and mental health applications and tools to assess
        those methods. The goal of the workshop is to foster research combining text and speech, with other multimodal
        inputs, including images, videos, wearable devices, survey, structured, spatio-temporal data, and knowledge
        bases. We invite papers which focus on the topics of interest include (but is not limited to):

        <li>Multimodal or cross-modal learning for cognitive or mental health</li>
        <li>Datasets for multimodal machine learning for cognitive or mental health</li>

    <p>
        We are inviting submission of short papers (4 pages) or long papers (8 pages). Authors can submit an unlimited
        number of pages for references and supplementary material, but supplementary material will not necessarily be
        reviewed. All submissions must be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy. Insufficiently
        anonymized submissions will be considered for desk-reject.

    <!-- <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>
        Submit your one page summary online via the 2023 MASC-SLL Openreview site

    </p>
    <p>
        Summaries should be no more than one page, not including references. If an under-review or published paper has
        more than one page, the authors need to submit a one-page version of the paper and specify as a footnote the
        name of the conference at which the original work is published or under review. You should summarize the
        motivation, contributions, methods, and evaluation schemes of the research conducted by the authors. </p>
    <p>
        Summaries should conform to ACL style guidelines. LaTeX style files, along with a style guide, are available at
        <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files">https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files</a>. Authors may
        NOT need a separate "abstract" section in your submission. Please include all names and affiliations in the
        summary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Summaries reviewing will NOT be blind. All accepted summaries will be non-archival; authors can submit them to
        subsequent conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cross-Submission Policy</strong>: MASC-SLL 2023 welcomes submissions that are under review or have been
        published at recent scientific conferences. Please double-check the policies of those conferences to make sure
        that submitting to non-archival venues is allowed. At the time of submission, we will ask the authors to
        indicate whether the submission is unpublished, or is a short version of an under-review or published paper.
