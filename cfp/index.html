    <h2>Coming soon!</h2>
    <!-- <p>
        The 10th annual <strong>Mid-Atlantic Student Colloquium on Speech, Language and Learning</strong> will be hosted at George Mason University, Arlington campus, Virginia on <strong>April 22nd, 2023</strong>. The Student Colloquium is intended to bring together students taking computational approaches to speech, language, and learning, so that they can introduce their research to the local student community, give and receive feedback, and engage each other in collaborative discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students are encouraged to submit an one page summary describing ongoing, planned or completed research projects, including previously published results and negative results. Student research in any field applying computational methods to any aspect of human language, including speech and learning, from all areas of computer science, linguistics, engineering, neuroscience, information science, and related fields, is welcome. Submissions and presentations must be made by students or postdocs. Accepted submissions will be presented as either posters or talks.
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be no registration fee. Students and postdocs are encouraged to consult with their supervisors about potential reimbursement of travel expenses.
    </p>

    <h2>Submission</h2>
    <p>
        Submit your one page summary online via the 2023 MASC-SLL Openreview site
        <center>

        </center>
    </p>
    <p>
        Summaries should be no more than one page, not including references. If an under-review or published paper has more than one page, the authors need to submit a one-page version of the paper and specify as a footnote the name of the conference at which the original work is published or under review. You should summarize the motivation, contributions, methods, and evaluation schemes of the research conducted by the authors.    </p>
    <p>
        Summaries should conform to ACL style guidelines. LaTeX style files, along with a style guide, are available at <a href="https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files">https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files</a>. Authors may NOT need a separate "abstract" section in your submission. Please include all names and affiliations in the summary.
    </p>
    <p>
        Summaries reviewing will NOT be blind. All accepted summaries will be non-archival; authors can submit them to subsequent conferences.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Cross-Submission Policy</strong>: MASC-SLL 2023 welcomes submissions that are under review or have been published at recent scientific conferences. Please double-check the policies of those conferences to make sure that submitting to non-archival venues is allowed. At the time of submission, we will ask the authors to indicate whether the submission is unpublished, or is a short version of an under-review or published paper.
    </p>
