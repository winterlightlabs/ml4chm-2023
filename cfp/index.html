    <h2></h2>
    <p>This workshop has three primary goals:
    <ol>
        <li>bring together experts from multiple disciplines working on
            machine learning (ML) and cognitive and mental health (CMH) to learn from each other,</li>
        <li>encourage the development of shared goals and approaches across these
            communities, and </li>
        <li>stimulate creation of better multimodal technologies for real-world CMH impact</li>
    </ol>
    To achieve these goals, our workshop will invite diverse research combining different fields of ML and CMH,
    including computer vision (CV), natural language processing (NLP), multimodal learning, signal processing,
    human-computer interaction, neuroscience, psychiatry, and psychology. We are especially encouraging submission of
    research combining multiple data sources and multimodal learning for CMH. Recently, a few works have
    started to exploit the synchronization of multimodal streams to improve prediction of patient status or response
    to treatment in CMH applications. This workshop encourages and promotes research efforts
    towards more inclusive multimodal technologies for CMH applications and tools to assess
    those methods. We invite papers which focus on the topics of interest include (but is not limited to):
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Datasets and benchmarks (e.g. speech, videos, EEG, fMRI, wearable sensors) for CMH
        </li>
        <li>Multi-task learning for CMH</li>
        <li>Multimodal or cross-modal learning for CMH combining modules such as imaging,
            language, speech, videos, genomic data, spatial-temporal data, EHR records</li>
        <li>Evaluation and analysis of models for CMH</li>
        <li>Interpretability of ML models for CMH</li>
        <li>Bias and fairness of ML models for CMH</li>
        <li>Multilingual machine learning for CMH</li>
        <li>CMH disease classification and prediction</li>
        <li>CMH biomarkers for measuring response to treatments</li>
        <li>CMH disease model-building and clinical decision support</li>
        <li>Distributed and federated learning for CMH applications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Anyone can register to attend the workshop through <a href="https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/registration/">AAAI
            2024 website</a>. It is a paid registration. Early registration
        ends December 20th.</p>
    <p>
    <p>
        We are inviting submission of short papers (4 pages) or long papers (8 pages). Authors can submit an unlimited
        number of pages for references and supplementary material, but supplementary material will not necessarily be
        reviewed. All submissions must be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy. Insufficiently
        anonymized submissions will be considered for desk-reject. Submit your work through <a
            href="https://openreview.net/group?id=AAAI.org/2024/Workshop/ML4CMH">OpenReview</a>. Deadline for paper
        submission is November 24th, 2023 AOE. Use a paper template from <a href="https://aaai.org/authorkit24-2/">AAAI
            2024 Author Kit</a> and select keywords from this <a
            href="https://aaai.org/aaai-conference/aaai-24-keywords/">keyword list.</a>
    </p>
    <p> In addition, we will host a mentorship program, in order to increase reach and to help researchers from
        across the world who are new to this field to improve the quality of their papers before the submission time. If
        you are interested in being part of a mentorship program, please submit your work before November 1st, 2023, AOE
        and you will be assigned a mentor who will review your paper and give you feedback by November 10th, so
        that you have enough time to improve your paper before the final submission. The reviewers of your final paper
        will be different from your mentor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The workshop proceedings are slated for publication on https://ceur-ws.org/, establishing this as an archival
        workshop. Consequently, it is imperative that all submitted papers are original and have not been published or
        submitted elsewhere. Submissions found to be duplicates, including those previously published or under
        consideration for other conferences or workshops, will not be taken into consideration.
