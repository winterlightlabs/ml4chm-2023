        <strong>Title:</strong><br>“Not so fast!”: Revisiting assumptions in (and about) Natural Language Reasoning<br>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>In recent years, the field of Natural Language Processing has seen a profusion of
        tasks, datasets, and systems that facilitate reasoning about real-world situations through language (e.g., RTE,
        MNLI, COMET). Such systems might, for example, be trained to consider a situation where “somebody dropped a
        glass on the floor,” and conclude it is likely that “the glass shattered” as a result. In this talk, I will
        discuss three pieces of work that revisit assumptions made by or about these systems. In the first work, I
        develop a Defeasible Inference task, which enables a system to recognize when a prior assumption it has made may
        no longer be true in light of new evidence it receives. The second work I will discuss revisits partial-input
        baselines, which have highlighted issues of spurious correlations in natural language reasoning datasets and led
        to unfavorable assumptions about models’ reasoning abilities. In particular, I will discuss experiments that
        show models may still learn to reason in the presence of spurious dataset artifacts. Finally, I will touch on
        work analyzing harmful assumptions made by reasoning models in the form of social stereotypes, and how these
        stereotypes may be uncovered automatically.<br>

        <strong>Title:</strong><br>Is My NLP Model Working? The Answer is Harder Than You Think<br>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>As natural language processing now permeates many different applications, its
        practical use is unquestionable. However, at the same time NLP is still imperfect, and errors cause everything
        from minor inconveniences to major PR disasters. Better understanding when our NLP models work and when they
        fail is critical to the efficient and reliable use of NLP in real-world scenarios. So how can we do so? In this
        talk I will discuss two issues: automatic evaluation of generated text, and automatic fine-grained analysis of
        NLP system results, which are some first steps towards a science of NLP model evaluation.<br>
        <strong>Brief Bio:</strong><br>Graham Neubig is an associate professor at the Language Technologies Institute of
        Carnegie Mellon University and CEO of Inspired Cognition. His research focuses on natural language processing,
        with a focus on multilingual NLP, natural language interfaces to computers, and machine learning methods for NLP
        system building and evaluation. His final goal is that every person in the world should be able to communicate
        with each-other, and with computers in their own language. He also contributes to making NLP research more
        accessible through open publishing of research papers, advanced NLP course materials and video lectures, and
        open-source software, all of which are available on his <a href="http://www.phontron.com/"

        <strong>Title:</strong><br>NLP Applications in Mental Health<br>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>With the ever-increasing usage of social media to either explicitly seek help or
        to simply share thoughts and feelings, we, in the computational disciplines, have the opportunity to utilize
        such data for building datasets, models, and doing analysis. I will share our collaborative work done at the
        Information Retrieval Lab at Georgetown University on detecting and summarizing mental health concerns in social
        media posts. The first application is on a dedicated mental health forum with the goal of triaging the severity
        of users’ posts to detect early the potential of self-harm. In the second type of platform, i.e., non-dedicated,
        we focus on the question of whether we can detect if a user is suffering from any one or more of nine mental
        health conditions, only using the *general language* of the user; that is, the posts are not in mental health
        [sub]forums nor have any mental health related words. Detecting mental health conditions based on a relatively
        smaller number of posts generally is not promising; hence it is important to mitigate our approaches so that
        such low resource users do not go undetected; we show that changing the sensitivity of ML models by adjusting
        the decision boundary threshold based on the volume of available data improves the detection rate. Identifying
        whether a given mental health condition of a user is a recent condition, similarly, whether the user currently
        suffers from a condition, are important questions yet challenging tasks as our efforts have shown us. Finally,
        to address information reduction for a faster read and processing of users’ posts by moderators/counselors, I
        will provide our efforts to summarize the posts to their short forms. <br>

        of the Information Retrieval Lab at Georgetown University, which she co-founded in 2010. She joined the Illinois
        Institute of Technology (IIT) from industry in 2000. Her research and doctoral student mentorship span the

        she was recognized with the IIT Julia Beveridge Award for faculty (university-wide female faculty of the year)
        in 2009, the College of Science and Letters Dean’s Excellence Award in Teaching in 2005, and in 2002, 2003, and
        2007, the Computer Science Department Teacher of the Year Award. She served as Senior/Area Chairs at multiple
        ACL conferences. She is SIGIR Women in Information retrieval (WIR) chair since 2019, focusing on gender pay
        inequity and women leadership.
