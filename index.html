  <h3>Machine Learning for Cognitive and Mental Health Workshop</h3>

  <p>
    With a COVID-19 magnified mental health crisis and growing old population (10.7% of population aged over 65 is
    diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and 18% is diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI)) there is an immediate
    need for developing systems that can better understand and characterize cognitive and mental health (CMH) by
    tracking various biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), speech,
    electronic health record (EHR), movement, cognitive surveys, wearable devices, structured, genomic, and epigenomic
    data. One of the core technical opportunities for accelerating the computational analysis of CMH lies in multimodal
    (MM) ML: learning representations that model the heterogeneity and interconnections between diverse input signals.
    MM is particularly important in CMH primarily due to the presence of noisy labels and subjectivity inherent in
    surveys. The utilization of multiple signals and modalities offers a potential solution to overcome these
    challenges.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recently, major progress has been made in pre-trained deep and MM learning from text, speech, images, video,
    signals, and structured data, and there has also been initial success towards using deep learning and MM streams to
    improve prediction of patient status or response to treatment in CMH applications. However, there remains
    computational and theoretical challenges that need to be solved in machine learning for CMH, spanning
  <ol>
    <li>collecting and sharing quality data for moderate and severe patients,</li>
    <li>learning from many diverse and understudied signals,</li>
    <li>theoretically understanding the natural way of modality connections and interactions in MM learning, </li>
    <li>real-world deployment concerns such as safety, robustness, interpretability, and collaboration with various
      stakeholders, and</li>
    <li>extending models to low resource and multilingual environments.</li>
  </ol>
