      With a mental health crisis and growing old population, there is an
      immediate need for developing systems that can better understand cognitive
      and mental health (CMH) tracking various biomarkers from fMRI, EEG,
      speech, movement, cognitive surveys, wearable devices, genomic and
      epigenomic data. One of the core technical opportunities for accelerating
      the computational analysis of CMH lies in multimodal (MM) machine learning
      (ML): learning representations that model the heterogeneity and
      interconnections between diverse input signals. Recently, major progress
      has been made in MM learning from text, speech, images, or video (Baevski
      et al., 2022; Ramesh et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2022), and there has also
      been initial success towards using MM streams to improve prediction of
      patient status or response to treatment in CMH applications (Zhu et al.,
      2018; Zhang et al., 2019; Venugopalan et al., 2021; Ehghaghi et al., 2022;
      Ilias et al, 2022; Shellikeri et al., 2022; Qiu et al., 2022). However,
      there remains computational and theoretical challenges that need to be
      solved in MM learning for CMH, spanning (1) collecting and sharing quality
      MM data for moderate and severe patients, (2) high-modality learning from
      many diverse and understudied signals, (3) theoretically understanding the
      natural way of modality connections and interactions, (4) real-world
      deployment concerns such as safety, robustness, interpretability, and
      collaboration with various stakeholders, and (5) extending MM models for
      extremely low resource and multilingual environments.

      This workshop has three primary goals: (1) bring together experts from
      multiple disciplines working on MM and CMH to learn from each other, (2)
      encourage the development of shared goals and approaches across these
      communities, and (3) stimulate creation of better MM technologies for
      real-world CMH impact. To achieve these goals, our workshop will include a
      diverse lineup of invited speakers across fields associated with MM and
      CMH, hosting experts from ML, CV, NLP, MM learning, neuroscience, and
      psychology. Our workshopâ€™s combination of talks, papers, and panel
      discussions will spur further collaboration toward the advancement of MM
      for CMH.
